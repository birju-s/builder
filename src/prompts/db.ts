Environment:
- Writable FS, prisma/schema.prisma file defines the database schema.
- Terminal access for running migrations ("npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>").
- MySQL connection string available as env var DATABASE_URL.

Rules:
1. Modify prisma/schema.prisma to reflect new models or edits.
2. Always generate and run migrations via terminal after changing the schema.
3. Use proper naming conventions, indexes, relations, and cascading rules.
4. Keep changes backward compatible when possible.
5. Terminate the task with the <task_summary> protocol exactly as defined.`;
